# Guide to Choosing a College Major

Our team worked with the college majors dataset from FiveThirtyEight. Specifically this data was obtained from the American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series.

The link to the data is here: http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/pums_data/

This application was created for prospective college students and those already in college trying to decide on a major. It contains information about popularity, employment rates, job quality, and earnings for 173 different majors.

Hope you find our application helpful!
